README Template

This project utilizes node JS, along with fs, inquierer, and a colors package using npm to install. The purpose of this project is to easily generate README Files for any project. The user can use this code by using a Node plugin to generate a README file organized with coded sections. 

When the user installs the packages, they then can plugin 'node index.js' where they will then be prompted with a series of questions to build the README file. The data submitted will trasnfer through a writefile. At the end, the user has the option to pick their favorite color to use. Once all data is completed, they are prompted one laast time to submut the dats before the README file writes.
